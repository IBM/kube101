# Kubernetes

* k8s for short
* Founded by Google
* CNCF: Cloud Native Computing Foundation
* Container Management


!SLIDE[bg=_images/backgrounds/white_bg.png]

# What is a container

* Usually, just a Docker container
* Strictly, the Open Container Initiative manages this definition
* Process on Linux\*, subject to some sandboxing and restrictions

# Container Management

* Start some containers!
* Which containers are running?
* Did it crash? Restart it!
* Make more of them, but keep them on different physical hosts

# Kubernetes Resources

* Pod
* Deployment
* Service


!SLIDE[bg=_images/backgrounds/white_bg.png] incremental

# Pod

* Smallest unit of deployment
* Consists usually of one container
* Has an image, version, exposed port, etc


!SLIDE[bg=_images/backgrounds/white_bg.png] incremental

# Deployment

* Deployments manage *replicasets*
* Replicasets manage pods
* Entrypoint for more advanced rollout strategies


!SLIDE[bg=_images/backgrounds/white_bg.png] incremental

# Service

* Exposes a single ip to the rest of the cluster
* Almost like a load balancer
* Maps to one or more pods
* There are a couple different kinds
