# Lab 3: Scale and update apps natively, building multi-tier applications.

In this lab you'll learn how to deploy the same guestbook application we
deployed in the previous labs, however, instead of using the `kubectl`
command line helper functions we'll be deploying the application using
configuration files. The configuration file mechanism allows you to have more
fine-grained control over all of resources being created within the
Kubernetes cluster.

Before we work with the application we need to clone a github repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/guestbook.git
```

This repo contains multiple versions of the guestbook application
as well as the configuration files we'll use to deploy the pieces of the application.

Change directory by running the command `cd guestbook`. You will find all the
configurations files for this exercise under the directory `v1`.

# 1. Scale apps natively

Kubernetes can deploy an individual pod to run an application but when you
need to scale it to handle a large number of requests a `Deployment` is the
resource you want to use.
A Deployment manages a collection of similar pods. When you ask for a specific number of replicas
the Kubernetes Deployment Controller will attempt to maintain that number of replicas at all times.

Every Kubernetes object we create should provide two nested object fields
that govern the objectâ€™s configuration: the object `spec` and the object
`status`. Object `spec` defines the desired state, and object `status`
contains Kubernetes system provided information about the actual state of the
resource. As described before, Kubernetes will attempt to reconcile
your desired state with the actual state of the system.

For Object that we create we need to provide the `apiVersion` you are using
to create the object, `kind` of the object we are creating and the `metadata`
about the object such as a `name`, set of `labels` and optionally `namespace`
that this object should belong.

Consider the following deployment configuration for guestbook application

**guestbook-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  labels:
    app: guestbook
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: guestbook
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: guestbook
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: guestbook
        image: ibmcom/guestbook:v1
        ports:
        - name: http-server
          containerPort: 3000
```

The above configuration file create a deployment object named 'guestbook'
with a pod containing a single container running the image
`ibmcom/guestbook:v1`.  Also the configuration specifies replicas set to 3
and Kubernetes tries to make sure that at least three active pods are running at
all times.

- Create guestbook deployment

   To create a Deployment using this configuration file we use the
   following command:

   ``` console
   $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
   deployment "guestbook" created
   ```

- List the pod with label app=guestbook

  We can then list the pods it created by listing all pods that
  have a label of "app" with a value of "guestbook". This matches
  the labels defined above in the yaml file in the
  `spec.template.metadata.labels` section.

   ```console 
   $ kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook
   ```

When you change the number of replicas in the configuration, Kubernetes will
try to add, or remove, pods from the system to match your request. To can
make these modifications by using the following command:

   ```console
   $ kubectl edit deployment guestbook
   ```

This will retrieve the latest configuration for the Deployment from the
Kubernetes server and then load it into an editor for you. You'll notice
that there are a lot more fields in this version than the original yaml
file we used. This is because it contains all of the properties about the
Deployment that Kubernetes knows about, not just the ones we chose to
specify when we create it. Also notice that it now contains the `status`
section mentioned previously.

You can also edit the deployment file we used to create the Deployment
to make changes. You should use the following command to make the change
effective when you edit the deployment locally.

   ```console
   $ kubectl apply -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
   ```

This will ask Kubernetes to "diff" our yaml file with the current state
of the Deployment and apply just those changes.

We can now define a Service object to expose the deployment to external
clients.

**guestbook-service.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: guestbook
  labels:
    app: guestbook
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: http-server
  selector:
    app: guestbook
  type: LoadBalancer
```

The above configuration creates a Service resource named guestbook. A Service
can be used to create a network path for incoming traffic to your running
application.  In this case, we are setting up a route from port 3000 on the
cluster to the "http-server" port on our app, which is port 3000 per the
Deployment container spec.

- Let us now create the guestbook service using the same type of command
  we used when we created the Deployment:

  ` $ kubectl create -f guestbook-service.yaml `

- Test guestbook app using a browser of your choice using the url
  `<your-cluster-ip>:<node-port>`

  Remember, to get the `nodeport` and `public-ip` use:

  `$ kubectl describe service guestbook`
  and
  `$ ibmcloud cs workers <name-of-cluster>`

# 2. Connect to a back-end service.

If you look at the guestbook source code, under the `guestbook/v1/guestbook`
directory, you'll notice that it is written to support a variety of data
stores. By default it will keep the log of guestbook entries in memory.
That's ok for testing purposes, but as you get into a more "real" environment
where you scale your application that model will not work because
based on which instance of the application the user is routed to they'll see
very different results.

To solve this we need to have all instances of our app share the same data
store - in this case we're going to use a redis database that we deploy to our
cluster. This instance of redis will be defined in a similar manner to the guestbook.

**redis-master-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-master
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: master
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
      role: master
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
        role: master
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis-master
        image: redis:2.8.23
        ports:
        - name: redis-server
          containerPort: 6379
```

This yaml creates a redis database in a Deployment named 'redis-master'.
It will create a single instance, with replicas set to 1, and the guestbook app instances
will connect to it to persist data, as well as read the persisted data back.
The image running in the container is 'redis:2.8.23' and exposes the standard redis port 6379.

- Create a redis Deployment, like we did for guestbook:

    ```console
    $ kubectl create -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
    ```

- Check to see that redis server pod is running:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get pods -lapp=redis,role=master
    NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    redis-master-q9zg7   1/1       Running   0          2d
    ```

- Let us test the redis standalone:

    ` $ kubectl exec -it redis-master-q9zg7 redis-cli `

    The kubectl exec command will start a secondary process in the specified
    container. In this case we're asking for the "redis-cli" command to be
    executed in the container named "redis-master-q9zg7".  When this process
    ends the "kubectl exec" command will also exit but the other processes in
    the container will not be impacted.

    Once in the container we can use the "redis-cli" command to make sure the
    redis database is running properly, or to configure it if needed.

    ```console
    redis-cli> ping
    PONG
    redis-cli> exit
    ```

Now we need to expose the `redis-master` Deployment as a Service so that the
guestbook application can connect to it through DNS lookup. 

**redis-master-service.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-master
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: master
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: redis-server
  selector:
    app: redis
    role: master
```

This creates a Service object named 'redis-master' and configures it to target
port 6379 on the pods selected by the selectors "app=redis" and "role=master".

- Create the service to access redis master:

    ``` $ kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml ```

- Restart guestbook so that it will find the redis service to use database:

    ```console
    $ kubectl delete deploy guestbook 
    $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
    ```

- Test guestbook app using a browser of your choice using the url:
  `<your-cluster-ip>:<node-port>`
  
You can see now that if you open up multiple browsers and refresh the page
to access the different copies of guestbook that they all have a consistent state.
All instances write to the same backing persistent storage, and all instances
read from that storage to display the guestbook entries that have been stored.

We have our simple 3-tier application running but we need to scale the
application if traffic increases. Our main bottleneck is that we only have
one database server to process each request coming though guestbook. One
simple solution is to separate the reads and write such that they go to
different databases that are replicated properly to achieve data consistency.

![rw_to_master](../images/Master.png)

Create a deployment named 'redis-slave' that can talk to redis database to
manage data reads. In order to scale the database we use the pattern where
we can scale the reads using redis slave deployment which can run several
instances to read. Redis slave deployments is configured to run two replicas.

![w_to_master-r_to_slave](../images/Master-Slave.png)

**redis-slave-deployment.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: slave
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
      role: slave
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
        role: slave
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis-slave
        image: kubernetes/redis-slave:v2
        ports:
        - name: redis-server
          containerPort: 6379
```

- Create the pod  running redis slave deployment.
 ``` $ kubectl create -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml ```

 - Check if all the slave replicas are running
 ```console
$ kubectl get pods -lapp=redis,role=slave
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-slave-kd7vx   1/1       Running   0          2d
redis-slave-wwcxw   1/1       Running   0          2d
 ```

- And then go into one of those pods and look at the database to see
  that everything looks right:

 ```console
$ kubectl exec -it redis-slave-kd7vx  redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "guestbook"
127.0.0.1:6379> lrange guestbook 0 10
1) "hello world"
2) "welcome to the Kube workshop"
127.0.0.1:6379> exit
```

Deploy redis slave service so we can access it by DNS name. Once redeployed,
the application will send "read" operations to the `redis-slave` pods while
"write" operations will go to the `redis-master` pods.

**redis-slave-service.yaml**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis-slave
  labels:
    app: redis
    role: slave
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 6379
    targetPort: redis-server
  selector:
    app: redis
    role: slave
```

- Create the service to access redis slaves.
    ``` $ kubectl create -f redis-slave-service.yaml ```

- Restart guestbook so that it will find the slave service to read from.
    ```console
    $ kubectl delete deploy guestbook
    $ kubectl create -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
    ```
    
- Test guestbook app using a browser of your choice using the url `<your-cluster-ip>:<node-port>`.

That's the end of the lab. Now let's clean-up our environment:

```console
$ kubectl delete -f guestbook-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f guestbook-service.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f redis-slave-service.yaml
$ kubectl delete -f redis-slave-deployment.yaml 
$ kubectl delete -f redis-master-service.yaml 
$ kubectl delete -f redis-master-deployment.yaml
```
